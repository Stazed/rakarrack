ATTENTION!!
This repository is no longer being used. The project has been forked and is now being developed
as "Rakarrack-plus" at https://github.com/Stazed/rakarrack-plus.
May 2, 2020.

Please note, there were three inadvertent commits to master on 2/14/20 that were reverted on 2/15/20.
The commits were intended for another repository used for conversion purposes to rakarrack-plus.
The master branch on this repository should be functional now.
There are no backwards incompatible changes planned for this repository.

Apologies for any inconvenience....



To build both rakarrack and rkr.lv2:
From top checkout directory:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install (as root)
    
To remove:
    make uninstall (as root)

The Carla presets originally included with rkr.lv2 are no longer included with
the download. They can be generated and installed by setting the "BuildCarlaPresets"
flag (OFF by default). Use:

    cmake -DBuildCarlaPresets=ON ..

To build Rakarrack only set "BuildLV2Plugins" to OFF:

    cmake -DBuildLV2Plugins=OFF ..
    
To build rkr.lv2 only set "BuildRakarrack" to OFF

    cmake -DBuildRakarrack=OFF ..

Release-0.7.1

This release includes major changes to make maintenance easier in the future... for me.
The massive rakarrack.cxx file was moved to a new UI directory and parsed into the individual gui.fl
files. All efx and sub windows are now in separate .fl files. The regular functions that are
not needed for gui display were moved to a new rkrprocess_gui.cxx file. The function definitions
are still included in the rakarrack.h file generated by fluid. These changes will be unseen by the 
end user. A number of other changes were also done to improve clarity.

Enhancements:
    Tooltips added for scope and analyzer.
    MIDI Program Change Table (Settings/MIDI) display was fixed.
    New 'Load' and 'Save' buttons added for the user Program Change Tables.
    Font size (Settings/Look) reset button change is now immediate.
    Hide Unused Effect Widgets button change (Settings/Look) is now immediate.
    Fix some uninitialized variables & invalid reads - thanks to valgrind.

Release-0.7.0

This is the first official release of the merged Rakarrack and rkr.lv2 projects.
The build has been entirely moved to cmake.
    
In addition to merging of Rakarrack and rkr.lv2, this release contains many bug
fixes some notable enhancements:

Added to lv2 :
    Convolotron
    MIDIConverter
    
Added to Rakarrack: 
    SIGUSR1 & SIGINT for session support (applies only to .rkr preset saving, not banks).
    Added FFT button to MIDIConverter. Fixed jack MC out, channel and octave settings.
    Added command line -j option for changing client name.
    Added separate midi channel receive spin buttons for Harmonizer and Stereo Harmonizer.
    Added separate Recognize note optimization for Harmonizer, Stereo Harmonizer and Ring.
    Added F12 fullscreen to toggle.
    Fix preferences file saving for: Waveshape Resampling, Upsampling, UpQuality, DownQuality, UpAmount & Looper Size.
    Added additional hidden parameters to MuTroMojo so they can be adjusted by user.
    Modified VaryBand band volumes to be user adjustable instead of preset (backwards compatible).
    A number of tooltips added and keybinding fixed.
    Fixed file reading of user presets added, for Convolotron, Echotron and Reverbtron.
    ... and many more.
    
In addition many, many, many uninitialized variables and invalid buffer reads were fixed (thanks to valgrind).
This should make both Rakarrack and rkr.lv2 much more stable.

Original from rkrlv2 project https://github.com/ssj71/rkrlv2.git

This project is the rakarrack effects ported to LV2 plugins.
The ports are done such that hopefully when rakarrack gets
an active maintainer these will get merged into the original
project. This was forked from version 6.1 (git commit 7dba0c4bccf88740c56867568d5b218b4a131499).

To install simply download the files and open a terminal in the extracted directory
and execute:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 sudo make install

This will also install carla project files. These project files are the plugin
equivalent of the preset banks in the standalone rakarrack version. These must be in
/usr/share/rkr.lv2/ for reverbtron or echotron to work properly. 

EFFECTS (X - done, W - won't do, + - done with missing features)
[X] Lineal EQ
[X] Compressor
[X] Distortion 
[W] Overdrive - exact same engine as distortion, but has fewer controls, presets were added to dist.
[X] Echo 
[X] Chorus 
[X] Phaser
[X] Analog Phaser 
[W] Flanger - this is identical to the chorus, presets from this will be included there
[X] Reverb 
[X] Parametric EQ 
[X] Cabinet Emulation - created new class for it 
[X] AutoPan/Stereo Expander 
[+] Harmonizer - still need to do midi mode version
[X] Musical Delay 
[X] Noise Gate - Direct copy of Steve Harris's Gate ladspa plugin
[X] WahWah 
[X] AlienWah 
[X] Derelict 
[X] Valve 
[X] Dual Flange 
[X] Ring 
[X] Exciter 
[X] DistBand 
[X] Arpie 
[X] Expander 
[X] Shuffle 
[X] Synthfilter 
[X] VaryBand 
[W] Convolotron - these require special input files, adding complexity. other excellent lv2 convolution engines already exist
[W] Looper - other good lv2 loopers exist
[X] MuTroMojo 
[X] Echoverse 
[X] CoilCrafter 
[X] ShelfBoost 
[X] Vocoder 
[X] Sustainer

Here is the original rakarrack README:


This app was born after an informal conversation about effects for guitar using GNU/linux.
The major part of this apps are discontinued or simply not have new versions after few
years. Josep Andreu say on the IRC chat "I can made an app based on the effects set 
hiden on code of ZynAddSubFX (by Paul Nasca Octavian). Some time after here is the
result of our work... 

This app has 42 effects: EQ Lineal, Compressor, Distortion, Overdrive, Echo, Chorus,
Phaser, Flanger, Reverb , Parametric EQ, Wah Wah, Alienwha, Harmonizer etc. 
The effects are procesed in cascade... The order of effects are configurable by the user. 
The state of rack can be saved as 'presets'. Sets of presets can be stored as 'banks'. 
The rack also has an integrated tuner and can receive MIDI control orders and can send MIDI 
notes to MIDI devices like synthesizers.

rakarrack is a JACK app.

The dependencies are:

libfltk1.1
libxpm
libjack100.0
libasound2
libsamplerate0
libsndfile1
aconnect  (part of Debian Package alsa-utils, name may vary on other distributions)
jackd
libxft2

If you want to compile you will also need the development packages:

libxpm-dev 
libfltk1.1-dev
libjack-dev
libsndfile1-dev
libsamplerate0-dev
libasound2-dev
libxft-dev

The name of the packages are typical of the naming convention for Debian-based distributions.
These can be a little different for each distro. Use your package manager search function
to find the equivalent package for your distribution.

If you are new to building packages from source code on Linux you will need a few other things
to set up a minimal development environment.
1) g++ (the compiler)
2) make
3) autotools-dev

Then if compiling from git repository, you need these too.
1) git-core (it is probable you have this if you're reading this README as it is likely you already used it to git the code).
2) autogen

If working from a graphical environment, you may wish to install 
qjackctl or patchage to aid with configuring jackd and connecting JACK clients.
